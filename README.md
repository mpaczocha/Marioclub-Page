The HTML & CSS crash course from The Net Ninja YouTube channel.

1. Install template ("dist" + "src" folder structure) (npm i).
2. Run the "gulp" command in terminal.

We do all the work (file editing) in the src directory. Based on it, the page in the "dist" directory is built.
The only thing is to manually add images to "dist/images" folder, because html, js and css are generated automatically.
